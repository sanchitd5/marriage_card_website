// ── Kinetic dancers (a persistent chrome DUET, cyan wireframe accent) ────
// TWO loaded, rigged glTF humanoids share one canvas/renderer/camera, side
// by side: the Sketchfab "Armadrillo" (CC-BY-4.0, kimni88, 50-bone, T-pose)
// and "DP Techno Fairy Punk Set" (CC-BY-4.0, BilloXD) — the latter shipped
// as a static unrigged character set and rigged for this project with an
// EXPANDED 21-bone biped skeleton (subdivided spine + clavicles + wrists +
// finger-curls, arms A-pose-matched so they actually deform; built by a
// deterministic pure-Python re-rig, see assets/scene/fairy-punk/license.txt).
// Both dance to the background music
// across every panel: ambient decoration, no user interaction, no audio
// node of its own — a wedding-invitation duet motif, not a literal
// depiction of either half of the couple.
//
// This is a sibling to lightshow.js (same renderer posture, same
// context-loss / resize / visibility handling) but a completely separate,
// tiny context. It reads the OFFLINE music energy the lightshow already
// computes (appState.lightshow.energy) rather than opening a new AnalyserNode,
// so the two stay in lockstep and there is no extra audio cost.
//
// ── Two independent RIGS, one shared choreography engine ─────────────────
// Each rig gets its own Group (`rigGroup` → `turnGroup` → model), its own
// proxy/adapter set, and its own move-selection state (currentMove/
// moveStartBeat/moveMirror/prevDrop/headTrail) — see `createRigState`.
// Both rigs run the SAME `MOVE_TABLE`/move functions and the SAME beat/
// instrument-aware `updateMoveSelection`, driven by ONE shared music clock
// (energy/phase/beatAccent/ENV), so they read as two performers responding
// to the same track rather than one figure duplicated: each independently
// re-rolls its own weighted-random move pick on the same 8-beat grid (so
// they often lean toward the same move FAMILY when one instrument band
// dominates, but rarely land on the identical move/phase), and both
// independently trigger the `strike` accent on the same drop edge — the
// one moment they always hit together, like a rehearsed duet accent.
//
// ── Retargeting: a PORTABLE, joint-count-agnostic engine (dance-retarget.js) ──
// The choreography is authored once against a rig-agnostic PROXY layer (named
// joint ROLES, Unity-Humanoid / VRM-style), and a small retargeting engine maps
// those proxy rotations onto whatever bones a given model actually provides.
// Porting a NEW model needs only a role -> bone-name map: the engine derives the
// canonical->local axis mapping analytically from the captured bind pose (a
// quaternion change-of-basis), which is what replaces the old per-bone, per-rig
// trial-and-error axis-sign hunting. See dance-retarget.js for the full design
// and its honest limits (rest-pose normalization, bone roll, and leaf bones
// still take a small declared hint - the residual every retargeter carries).
//
// The two SHIPPING rigs are driven through that engine in EXPLICIT mode: each
// supplies the exact hand-tuned { rest, axis-map } it was verified with (built
// by makeExplicitHints from each rig's cfg), so the engine's explicit path is
// bit-identical to the original inline applyRig and both dancers look and move
// exactly as before - zero regression. The Armadrillo's arms rest in a T-pose
// along ±X so its hint folds an ARM_DOWN offset + a small FORE_REST elbow bend;
// the fairy-punk rig's bones are identity-rotation / world-aligned (arms follow
// the mesh A-pose) so its offsets are near-zero — no Z-sign flip needed, the
// A-pose IS a natural dance neutral. At load the engine ALSO measures,
// for the record, how close a purely-analytic derivation (no hints) gets to
// each hand-tuned bone (appState.dancer.retargetReport / console) - the honest
// evidence for how much of the manual tuning the auto path now recovers.
// GLTFLoader SANITIZES node names (spaces -> underscores, dots dropped); the
// engine's normalizeBoneName handles both source conventions.
//
// Safety & performance:
//  • reduced-motion → never runs (no WebGL init at all); CSS hides the canvas.
//  • RENDER STYLE: each mesh gets a SHADED chrome pass (MeshMatcapMaterial,
//    a procedurally generated matcap — no HDRI/network texture fetch, no
//    scene lights needed, matcap shading is a pure view-space normal lookup)
//    so sculpted form — including facial features — actually reads, plus a
//    thin additive cyan WIREFRAME pass on top as a "circuitry" accent (a
//    `.clone()` of the same mesh sharing the SAME Skeleton instance, so it
//    deforms for free with zero extra per-frame skinning cost). Wireframe
//    used to be the ONLY material; it's now an accent over sculpted chrome.
//  • BEAT ILLUMINATION: brightness (the wireframe accent's opacity + the
//    chrome pass's colour multiplier) pulses on the beat via the same
//    smooth, decaying `beatAccent` curve that drives the motion accent (not a
//    hard on/off flash). Checked against WCAG 2.3.1 (owner's call to proceed
//    regardless): this project's tracks run 125-150 BPM = 2.08-2.5 beats/sec,
//    under the 3-flashes/sec G19 ceiling at every tempo used here, independent
//    of amplitude — so a beat-locked glow is compliant by the simplest
//    sufficient technique, not just a stylistic risk.
//  • ORGANIC vs. ROBOTIC MOTION: procedural motion reads mechanical mainly
//    from PERFECT REPETITION and PERFECT SYMMETRY, not from a lack of
//    smoothing (that was already solved by the smoothstep fluidity pass).
//    Standard fix per character-animation practice is coherent noise (Perlin/
//    simplex is the canonical tool — Ken Perlin built it specifically to
//    escape "machine-like" CGI motion) layered onto otherwise-deterministic
//    motion, plus animation's "arcs" principle (curved, not symmetric,
//    paths read as alive). This file uses a cheap sine-hash in place of a
//    full noise function (bounded per-frame cost, same coherent-but-varied
//    property, sufficient for a handful of scalars): `musicClock()`'s
//    per-beat `beatJitter`, `dance()`'s per-move-instance `moveAmp`/
//    `movePhaseOfs` (rolled once per move pick — see updateMoveSelection),
//    and a second-harmonic asymmetry on the master `s` oscillator.
//  • SECONDARY-MOTION PHYSICS: `tgt`/`set` (inside dance()) are a spring-
//    mass-damper integrator, not a plain low-pass — see `springStep`/
//    SPRING_LIGHT/SPRING_HEAVY below dance()'s header comment for the full
//    rationale (short version: the user asked for PhysX/Euphoria; neither is
//    viable — Euphoria isn't licensable at all, PhysX-web is a multi-MB WASM
//    dependency this zero-runtime-dependency site can't take on — so this is
//    the from-scratch equivalent: real velocity/momentum/overshoot on the
//    proxy joints, tuned per-joint via a `__heavy` tag so head/neck/chest/
//    spine — which carry the skinned hair/wings/ornament — visibly follow
//    through a turn instead of moving rigidly with the bone).
//  • RAF pauses on hidden tab; dt clamped so a long pause can't lurch the pose.
//  • Async load: renderer/scene/camera/RAF start immediately (empty scene);
//    each rig's dance/adapter no-ops safely until ITS model arrives, so one
//    rig loading slower than the other never blocks the other's animation.
//    A failed load on either rig fails safe (that rig stays absent, no throw).

  // open-sourced as an SDK anyone can license; PhysX's web build is a
  // multi-MB WASM binary, and this project's CLAUDE.md states "zero runtime
  // dependencies" as a hard rule (no npm install, everything vendored). What
  // a physics engine would actually BUY here — hair/wings/fringe that swing
  // with real momentum and settle instead of moving rigidly with the bone —
  // is achievable with a proper spring-mass-damper integrator on the EXISTING
  // proxy joints, at zero extra dependency cost: neither rig has separate
  // hair/wing/cloth bones (hair is skinned to Head, wings/chest ornament to
  // Chest — see the recent attachment-fix commits), so giving Head/Chest (and
  // Neck/Spine, which drive them) real momentum makes the skinned hair/wing
  // geometry follow through for free, no new bones or Blender pass needed.
  //
  // The OLD `tgt`/`set` were a pure exponential low-pass (`x += (target-x)*k`)
  // — no velocity, no overshoot, ever. This is why nothing had physical
  // "weight": it eases directly onto the target and stops dead, the textbook
  // critically-overdamped response. A damped harmonic oscillator (semi-
  // implicit/symplectic Euler: integrate acceleration → velocity → position
  // each step, sub-stepped for stability) is the standard lightweight
  // technique for this in games ("spring bones") — same category of tool as
  // the coherent-noise/Markov-selection techniques already cited in this
  // file, deliberately NOT a physics-engine dependency.
  //
  // Two tuned profiles, chosen by damping ratio (zeta = k2 / (2*sqrt(k1))):
  // SPRING_LIGHT (limbs/pelvis, zeta≈0.90) stays close to the old snappy feel
  // — barely any overshoot, so legs/arms never read as loose or floppy.
  // SPRING_HEAVY (head/neck/chest/spine, zeta≈0.74) is deliberately more
  // underdamped — a visible settle/overshoot on quick direction changes is
  // the whole point, since that's what reads as hair/wing momentum. Both are
